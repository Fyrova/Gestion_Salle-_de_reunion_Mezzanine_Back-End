Updated save method outline for recurring reservations in ReservationService:

1. Check if reservation.recurrenceRule is null or empty:
   - If yes, proceed with existing save logic for single reservation.

2. If recurrenceRule is present:
   - Parse the recurrenceRule to determine recurrence pattern (e.g., using iCal RRULE parser).
   - Create and save the parent reservation (the series master).
   - Generate all occurrences (Reservation instances) based on recurrenceRule and parent reservation.
   - For each occurrence:
       - Set parentReservation to the parent.
       - Set date, startTime, endTime accordingly.
       - Validate the occurrence for conflicts.
       - Save the occurrence.
   - Return the parent reservation or list of occurrences as needed.

3. Handle exceptions and rollback if any occurrence conflicts or errors occur.

4. Publish creation event for the parent reservation.

Note: This outline requires implementing or integrating a recurrence rule parser and occurrence generator.

Next steps:
- Implement recurrence rule parsing and occurrence generation.
- Update API and frontend to support recurrence input and management.
